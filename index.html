    <h1>Logic @ BU (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome fellow logician!
      Logic @ BU is an informal community of faculty and students at <a href="https://www.bu.edu">Boston University</a> interested in mathematical and philosophical logic.
      We're something like an academic support group (as opposed to a formal research group) aimed at:
      <ul>
	<li>connecting people from disparate parts of the field within the university;</li>
	<li>organizing and promoting events, seminars, and courses;</li>
	<li>making logic more accessible, particularly to undergraduates with little-to-no background.</li>
      </ul>
      The group was born out of the observation that there are a surprisingly large number of people at BU interested in logic, and that, due to departmental silo-ing, this isn't immediately obvious.
      Our primarly goal is ultimately to bridge this gap, creating a clearer entry point into logic at BU.
